/*
    (a) Being able to divide a program into many components avoids having a monolith program, where everything is done by a single entity. This allows each program to be divided into few, specialized programs that focus on things very well. This also makes it easier when collaborating with people (each person can oversee a few files instead of everyone working on the same file)
    (b) Organization of the project structure is still necessary, and you have to link every file needed by the project (if you forget a file, you might get into problems)
